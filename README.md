# Website-scrolling-gallery
Website with deep scrolling on pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </br>
It has a soundtrack (a button at the bottom right), it is also adaptive to all screens, since a rubber layout is used.

The site is available at the link: https://vanissim0.github.io/Website-scrolling-gallery/
